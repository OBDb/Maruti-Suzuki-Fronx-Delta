    description: "The Maruti Suzuki Fronx Delta represents a specific trim level of the first-generation Fronx, a compact crossover SUV developed for the Indian market and sold through Maruti's premium NEXA dealership network. Built on Suzuki's HEARTECT platform shared with the Baleno hatchback, the Fronx features coupe-SUV styling with a sloping roofline, distinctive front fascia with split LED headlamps, and a prominent grille. The Delta trim positions itself as a mid-range variant, offering a balance between affordability and features. Powertrain options for the Delta trim typically include a 1.2-liter naturally aspirated petrol engine (K12C) producing approximately 90 horsepower and 113 Nm of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed AMT (Automated Manual Transmission). Standard features in the Delta trim include a 7-inch Smartplay touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, automatic climate control, keyless entry, push-button start, LED projector headlamps with LED DRLs, 16-inch styled steel wheels, and electrically adjustable and folding outside mirrors. Safety equipment includes dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, and an electronic stability program. Interior appointments feature fabric seat upholstery, a 60:40 split-folding rear seat, and rear AC vents. The Fronx Delta, like other variants in the lineup, aims to combine the practicality and higher seating position of an SUV with the maneuverability and efficiency of a hatchback, targeting urban Indian consumers seeking a premium compact crossover experience at an accessible price point. As the first generation of this model, the Fronx represents Maruti Suzuki's expansion into the rapidly growing compact SUV segment with a distinctive coupe-crossover design approach."
